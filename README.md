# Jacob Gast's Interactive Resume

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## First step

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the `Node Package Manager (npm)` and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for its CLI
installed on your machine. Then navigate to the root folder of this application and run `npm install` to install all packages in use.
Then when you're ready to run the app, see the `Development server` section just below.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## * Below is not needed to run the application, but to modify and test it to suit your needs *



## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Adding new packages

Add the package name and version to the `package.json` file located in the root directory and run `npm install` to install it in the `node_modules` folder.
Then `import` the module of the package into the page you plan to use it. Or you can import it into a module and add it to the imports section to make it
available to each file located in the declarations section.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
